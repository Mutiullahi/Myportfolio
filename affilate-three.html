        <h4> HOW TO MAKE MONEY ONLINE AS AN AFFILATE MARKETER WITH A SMART PHONE</h4>
        <p>
            Nowadays, making money online has become relatively easy, especially
             with the big bang in Affiliate Marketing and technological advancements.
              From the comfort of your home and with digital devices like your 
              smartphone, you can make money online without needing a laptop.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hitherto, most internet users believed that a laptop/PC is compulsory
             for a successful income stream. However, smartphones have become 
             significant for supplemental or passive income. Smartphones are
              as relevant as laptops because they do anything the latter does.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the focus of this article highlights the relevancy of smartphones
             to newbies or experienced affiliate marketers. Although the process is tedious,
              you can succeed with affiliate marketing using your smartphone.
            Caveat: This article doesn’t promise anything, nor does it override
             the importance of a PC or Laptop for better functionality and work 
             process as an affiliate marketer. However, it highlights the
             importance of a smartphone and how you can maximize it without a PC.

            Nowadays, anyone can make money from the comfort of their homes with
             less stress and, more importantly, with a digital device.
            During the invention of the Internet in the late 1980s, the internet was
            bland. Nobody imagined the possibility of the internet becoming a globally 
            sort-after thing. It was a complete waste of effort, or so they thought. However,
            it seems they thought differently with the dot-com bubble in the 1990s & 2000.
            But 30 years later, the internet is one of the many things that humankind ever did well.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to DataReportal, there are 5.03 billion internet users worldwide 
            (63.1% of the world’s population) and Africa, Eastern and Southern Asia make up 3 billion.
             These figures suggest that the internet holds a lot of possibilities because people live 
             their lives on the internet. And where people are gathered, there is money because problem 
             lurks among people.

        <h3> HOW TO MAXIMIZE YOUR SMARTPHONE FOR MAKING MONEY ONLINE</h3>
        <p>
            Many people believe the digital nomad lifestyle is only possible with a laptop, and without
             one, you can’t do anything to make money online. This statement is a lie.
            Indeed, a laptop is an essential tool for making money online and holds more significant
            benefits than a smartphone. However, your smartphone can do almost anything your laptop or PC does.
            Are you a programmer? There are several mobile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 
            available today, such as TrebEdit for web development, and Pydroid for Data analysts & Data scientists, etc.
            These IDEs come with a range of libraries also standard in laptops.
            You don’t need a laptop before you can maximize your time digitally or lead a digital nomad lifestyle.

        <h4>The following are 7 ways to make money with your smartphone, namely:</h4>
        <ol class="list-money">
            <li>Get started in Affiliate Marketing:</li>
            <p>
                According to Neil Patel, Affiliate marketing involves the promoting of other people’s products in return for a small commission for each sale.
It is a means of selling products you do not create. This income model provides you with passive income on a commission basis. In other words, you only get paid when you make a sale.
This model of money-making will is detailed in the next section. However, you can sign up on platforms like Digitstem, Expertnaire, or Learnoflix to get started.
            </p>
            <li> Sell your old stuff:</li>
            <p>
                Selling online has taken a whirlwind approach lately; you can find almost anything online, from your designer wears to the okirika (aka old/used) clothes.
You don’t have to sell only clothes or dresses that don’t fit anymore; even your old gadgets (i.e. phones, laptops, TV, refrigerators, etc.) are welcome.


All you need to do is register on platforms like Jiji.ng, OLX, Olist, etc., to get started. You don’t need a laptop to get started, just a smartphone, an internet connection, and the ability to take quality photos.
            </p>
            <li>Start an online store:</li>
            <p>
                You read earlier that you can sell your old stuff virtually. It shouldn’t be news that you can sell unused goods online too.

It is easy to start, and only a smartphone is needed to accomplish this feat. You can sell clothing accessories, books, household items, etc.


All you need to do is sign up on platforms like Jumia, Konga, Pocketapp by PiggyVest, etc. You can do this with a smartphone, not a laptop.

As always, you need a smartphone, internet connection, and an up-to-date inventory. Also, if you run a physical store, you can have an online side to it with your smartphone.
            </p>
            <li>Signup for a Rideshare:s</li>
            <p>
                Do you have a driver’s license? Then you’re sleeping on a truckload of money unknown to you. You must sign up for rideshares like Bolt or Uber via their mobile applications and get started.
Additionally, you can begin a logistics business and help retail companies deliver goods to their customers. This income model can become a side hustle or a full-time gig.
            </p>
            <li>Start a YouTube Channel:</li>
            <p>
                YouTube is a big thing nowadays because you can get answers for literally anything on the platform, and you can make money from it as well. The biggest earner on YouTube today is Ryan Kaji, who makes $29 million yearly on the platform.
Also, you don’t need expensive props to start a YouTube channel; your smartphone is a great first pacer. Your smartphone has a camera (front & back); all you need is an ideal setting to shoot the videos.



You can do this easily without breaking a neck. Also, there are several ways to earn via YT, such as partnerships with brands, Google AdSense, selling personal products, etc.
            </p>
            <li>Real Estate Investment Applications</li>
            <p>
                Investing in real estate is a big deal nowadays, as most of your favorite celebrities own large investment portfolios.
Getting into real estate is a snag because the cost is often unbearable for some. However, several investment platforms like Risevest, and Wealth.ng, & Oxfordvest, allow you the opportunity to invest in real estate. You can do this for as little as $10.
And your smartphone is the only needed criterion.
            </p>
            <li>Become a Lingual tutor</li>
            <p>
                An African proverb says a teacher’s reward is in heaven. If you love teaching, your reward can be here on Earth.
You can become a language teacher and teach people (tourists or locals) your favorite languages easily. You can sign up on platforms like Superprof with your smartphone to start.

In a nutshell, you can attest to the power of your smartphone. There are over a thousand ways to maximize your smartphone and make money passively with it.
Now let’s go back to the 1st example – making money with affiliate marketing. Is it even possible, you might wonder?
